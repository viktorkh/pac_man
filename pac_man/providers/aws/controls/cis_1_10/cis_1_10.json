    "title": "Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users that have a console password",
    "description": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of authentication assurance beyond traditional credentials. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to the AWS Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA token. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password.",
    "rationale": "Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the authenticating principal to possess a device that displays a time-sensitive key and have knowledge of a credential.",
    "remediation_type": "Automated",
    "profile_applicability": "Level 1",
    "audit_procedure": "Perform the following to determine if a MFA device is enabled for all IAM users having a console password:\n\nFrom Console:\n\n1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.\n2. In the left pane, select Users\n3. If the MFA or Password age columns are not visible in the table, click the gear icon at the upper right corner of the table and ensure a checkmark is next to both, then click Close.\n4. Ensure that for each user where the Password age column shows a password age, the MFA column shows Virtual, U2F Security Key, or Hardware.\n\nFrom Command Line:\n\n1. Run the following command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to generate a list of all IAM users along with their password and MFA status:\n\naws iam generate-credential-report\naws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d | cut -d, -f1,4,8\n\n2. The output of this command will produce a table similar to the following:\n\nuser,password_enabled,mfa_active\nelise,false,false\nbrandon,true,true\nrakesh,false,false\nhelene,false,false\nparas,true,true\nanitha,false,false\n\n3. For any column having password_enabled set to true , ensure mfa_active is also set to true.",
    "remediation_procedure": "Perform the following to enable MFA:\n\nFrom Console:\n\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at 'https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/'\n2. In the left pane, select Users.\n3. In the User Name list, choose the name of the intended MFA user.\n4. Choose the Security Credentials tab, and then choose Manage MFA Device.\n5. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Virtual MFA device, and then choose Continue.\n\nIAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes.\n\n6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications at https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/#Virtual_MFA_Applications). If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device).\n7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:\n   • Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code.\n   • In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.\nWhen you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords.\n8. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the MFA Code 1 box, type the one-time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the MFA Code 2 box.\n9. Click Assign MFA.",
